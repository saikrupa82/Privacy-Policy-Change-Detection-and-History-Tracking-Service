## History Management and JSON Format
PolicyTracker maintains a comprehensive history of changes to each tracked privacy policy. This section outlines how the history data is structured in JSON format, making it easy for developers and system administrators to interpret and utilize the stored data.

### JSON History File Structure
Each privacy policy tracked by the application has an associated JSON file that stores the history of changes. Below is a description of the key components of the JSON structure:

- **last_checked**: Timestamp indicating the last time the policy was checked for changes.
- **changes**: An array of change records, where each record represents a detected change during a policy check.
- **last_update**: Contains information about the most recent change including detailed changes, the timestamp of the change, and the new content.
``` bash
{
  "last_checked": "2024-04-22T12:00:00Z",
  "changes": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-04-21T12:00:00Z",
      "content": {
        "Introduction": [
          "The Privacy Policy has been updated to reflect recent changes to data protection laws."
        ],
        "Data Collection": [
          "We have expanded our data collection to include new analytical tools."
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "last_update": {
    "content": {
      "Introduction": [
        "The Privacy Policy has been updated to reflect recent changes to data protection laws."
      ],
      "Data Collection": [
        "We have expanded our data collection to include new analytical tools."
      ]
    },
    "timestamp": "2024-04-21T12:00:00Z",
    "detailed_changes": [
      {
        "section": "Introduction",
        "diff": [
          "- old content line 1",
          "+ new content line 1"
        ]
      },
      {
        "section": "Data Collection",
        "diff": [
          "- old content line 2",
          "+ new content line 2"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

```

### Accessing and Using JSON Data
The JSON history files are stored within the designated history folder for each policy, typically located at a path relative to the policy's HTML file. Developers can access these files to review historical data, generate reports, or integrate change tracking into other systems.

To ensure seamless integration and manipulation of JSON data:

- Utilize JSON parsing libraries available in most programming languages, such as json in Python, to load and manipulate the data programmatically.
- Employ tools and libraries designed for handling large JSON files if dealing with extensive historical data to optimize performance.

### Contributing to History Management
Contributors interested in enhancing the history tracking capabilities of PolicyTracker can consider:

- Improving the algorithms for change detection to capture more nuanced modifications.
- Extending the JSON structure to include more detailed metadata about changes.
- Optimizing the storage and retrieval of JSON files to enhance performance and scalability.

     - **Code Example:**
     ```python
     import subprocess

     # Sample URLs for stress testing
     urls = ['https://example.com/privacy', 'https://another.com/policy']

     for url in urls:
         # Running the tool repeatedly to test reliability
         subprocess.run(['python', 'fetchdata.py', url])
     ```
     - **Outcome:** Continuous monitoring and logging identified any defects encountered.

   - **Automated Testing:**
     - **Purpose:** To ensure consistent behavior and accurate outputs using predefined test cases.
     - **Methodology:** The `unittest` framework was used to simulate workflows, validate outputs, and test error handling.
     - **Code Example:**
     ```python
     import unittest
     from subprocess import run

     class PolicyScrapingTests(unittest.TestCase):

         def test_valid_url_scraping(self):
             # Ensure the tool returns success on a valid URL
             result = run(['python', 'fetchdata.py', 'https://example.com/privacy'])
             self.assertEqual(result.returncode, 0)

         def test_invalid_url_handling(self):
             # Ensure invalid URLs return errors
             result = run(['python', 'fetchdata.py', 'https://nonexistent-url.com'])
             self.assertNotEqual(result.returncode, 0)

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         unittest.main()
     ```
     - **Outcome:** Automated testing verified correct behavior and highlighted areas requiring improvement.

   - **Error Logging:**
     - **Purpose:** To track and analyze errors encountered during the scraping process.
     - **Methodology:** The `logging` module was used to create a detailed error log that captured defects and exceptions.
     - **Code Example:**
     ```python
     import logging

     # Configure logging for error tracking
     logging.basicConfig(filename='scraping_errors.log', level=logging.ERROR, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

     try:
         # Example scraping process with error handling
         response = requests.get('https://example.com/privacy')
         response.raise_for_status()  # Will raise an exception for failed requests
     except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
         # Log errors and continue processing
         logging.error(f"Error occurred while scraping URL: {e}")
     ```
     - **Outcome:** Error logs were used to identify and address frequent error patterns.

2. **Measuring Concurrency:**
   - **Simultaneous Instances:**
     - **Purpose:** To assess resource usage and performance when multiple users access the system concurrently.
     - **Methodology:** I used `subprocess` to run multiple instances of `fetchdata.py` concurrently, staggering the start times to simulate realistic load.
     - **Code Example:**
     ```python
     import subprocess
     import time

     # URLs for testing concurrent usage
     urls = ['https://example.com/privacy', 'https://another.com/policy']
     concurrent_instances = 5  # Number of parallel instances
     processes = []

     for i in range(concurrent_instances):
         # Rotate through URLs and start multiple instances
         process = subprocess.Popen(['python', 'fetchdata.py', urls[i % len(urls)]])
         processes.append(process)
         time.sleep(1)  # Optional stagger for realistic load

     # Wait for all processes to complete
     for process in processes:
         process.wait()
     ```
     - **Outcome:** Monitored resource usage and execution time for each instance to determine performance.

   - **Benchmarking Tools:**
     - **Purpose:** To generate user load, simulate concurrency, and identify potential bottlenecks.
     - **Methodology:** Load testing tools like `Apache JMeter` or `Locust` were configured to simulate user behavior and collect performance metrics.
     - **Code Implementation:** Not directly implemented in code here, but scripts were developed to support the test scenarios, and analysis of test results provided insights.


### Command Line Testing
Testing via the command line has proven the script's effectiveness in handling multiple URLs, reflecting the system's capability to scale and perform under load:

```bash
python fetchdata.py <URL1> <URL2> <URL3> ... <URLN>
```
OR

```bash
python fetchdata.py
```
