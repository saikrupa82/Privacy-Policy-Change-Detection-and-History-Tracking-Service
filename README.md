### Website Interaction
- **Data Source**: Begins with websites hosting privacy policies in their native HTML format.
- **Data Gathering Process**: Executes systematic HTTP GET requests to fetch data comprehensively.

``` bash
# Placeholder for actual scraping functionality
result = polipy.get_policy(url, screenshot=True)
result.save(output_dir='.')
```
### Scraping Model
- **Technology**: Utilizes Beautiful Soup 4 for converting complex HTML documents into a navigable and parsable structure.
- **Data Retrieval and Organization**: Converts raw HTML data into a structured format for further processing.

### Parsing Model
- **HTML Parsing**: Extracts relevant content from HTML documents using precise selectors to isolate key segments of privacy policies.
``` bash
def fetch_and_parse(file_path):
    print(f"Attempting to read and parse the file at: {file_path}")
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            soup = BeautifulSoup(file.read(), 'html.parser')
            print("File successfully parsed.")
            return soup
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to read or parse the file due to: {e}")
    return None

def extract_sections(soup):
    print("Extracting sections from HTML content.")
    sections = {}
    current_heading = None
    for element in soup.find_all(['h2', 'p']):
        if element.name == 'h2':
            current_heading = element.get_text(strip=True)
            sections[current_heading] = []
        elif element.name == 'p' and current_heading:
            sections[current_heading].append(element.get_text(strip=True))
    print("Sections successfully extracted.")
    return sections
```
### History Management Module
- **Change Detection**: Employs algorithms to detect changes by comparing new data against a historical baseline.
- **History Recording**: Documents changes to privacy policies over time, capturing their evolution.
``` bash
def compare_and_update_history(file_path, new_content, history_folder):
    print(f"Checking for existing history in: {history_folder}")
    os.makedirs(history_folder, exist_ok=True)
    history_filename = os.path.join(history_folder, os.path.basename(file_path).replace('.html', '_history.json'))

    history = {}
    try:
        with open(history_filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            history = json.load(file)
            print("Existing history found and loaded.")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("No history file found, creating a new one.")

    print("Comparing the new content with the last update.")
    last_update = history.get('last_update', {})
    changes_detected = False
    detailed_changes = []

    for section, texts in new_content.items():
        old_texts = last_update.get('content', {}).get(section, [])
        diff = list(difflib.unified_diff(old_texts, texts, lineterm=''))
        if diff:
            changes_detected = True
            detailed_changes.append((section, diff))
 ```
### Data Store
- **Storage Solutions**: Utilizes efficient storage mechanisms to organize and store the scraped data.
- **Data Usage**: Supports diverse applications from compliance tracking to advanced analytics.
``` bash

    if changes_detected:
        print("Changes detected. Updating history.")
        timestamp = datetime.now().isoformat()
        history.setdefault('changes', []).append({
            'timestamp': timestamp,
            'content': new_content
        })
        history['last_update'] = {
            'content': new_content,
            'timestamp': timestamp,
            'detailed_changes': detailed_changes
        }
    else:
        print("No changes detected.")

    print("Updating the last checked timestamp.")
    history['last_checked'] = datetime.now().isoformat()

    print("Saving the history to file.")
    with open(history_filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        json.dump(history, file, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)
```

### Email Notification Service:
The email notification feature alerts stakeholders when significant changes are detected in a monitored privacy policy. It ensures stakeholders remain informed about updates affecting compliance or data practices. The emails summarize detected changes, enabling recipients to respond promptly and maintain their understanding of privacy policy requirements.

- **Summarized Alerts**: Emails provide concise summaries of detected changes, highlighting sections with added, removed, or updated content.
- **Customizable Recipients**: Notifications can be sent to a list of recipients provided by the user.
- **Secure Transmission**: Uses TLS encryption to secure email data during transmission.

**Function**

```bash
def send_email(subject, body, sender, recipients, password):
    if isinstance(body, list):
        body = "\n\n".join(f"Section: {section}\n" + "\n".join(diff) for section, diff in body)

    msg = MIMEText(body)
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    msg['From'] = sender
    msg['To'] = ', '.join(recipients)

    try:
        with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) as smtp_server:
            smtp_server.starttls()  # Upgrade to a secure connection
            smtp_server.login(sender, password)
            smtp_server.sendmail(sender, recipients, msg.as_string())
        print("Message sent successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to send email: {e}")
```

Calling function 
``` bash
        send_email(subject, detailed_changes, useremail, recipients, password)

```

## Detailed Requirements :
### Functional Requirements:
- **Scrape Privacy Policy Data**:
By leveraging the polipy library, I created a scraping tool capable of extracting privacy policy data directly from websites, accommodating a wide range of HTML structures. Users can provide a URL or a local file path for the tool to process. The scraping module accurately identifies relevant sections and prepares them for further analysis using BeautifulSoup.
- **Maintain a History of Changes**:
I designed a database schema to chronologically organize each change in privacy policies. It uses JSON files stored in an organized directory structure. A history management module can clean up old history files and ensures that all changes are correctly documented and timestamped.
- **Detect Changes in Privacy Policies**:
With the difflib library, the system highlights differences between policy versions, displaying these as unified diffs. The change detection algorithm is able to detect even subtle differences, capturing modified or removed text precisely.
- **Receive Change Notifications via Email**:
Using smtplib, the tool sends email alerts summarizing changes detected in privacy policies. The emails provide actionable insights and include links for recipients to download or review detailed change reports.
Non-functional Requirements:
- **Security**:
By using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), data encryption at rest, and TLS during data transmission, sensitive information is protected. Authentication protocols and OAuth are also implemented to ensure secure user access.
- **Performance**:
With optimized search algorithms, caching of intermediate results, and efficient data validation methods, the system processes policies efficiently, even at high volume.
- **Data Integrity**:
Comprehensive validation, backups, and regular maintenance prevent data duplication and ensure historical accuracy.

## History Management and JSON Format
PolicyTracker maintains a comprehensive history of changes to each tracked privacy policy. This section outlines how the history data is structured in JSON format, making it easy for developers and system administrators to interpret and utilize the stored data.

### JSON History File Structure
Each privacy policy tracked by the application has an associated JSON file that stores the history of changes. Below is a description of the key components of the JSON structure:

- **last_checked**: Timestamp indicating the last time the policy was checked for changes.
- **changes**: An array of change records, where each record represents a detected change during a policy check.
- **last_update**: Contains information about the most recent change including detailed changes, the timestamp of the change, and the new content.
``` bash
{
  "last_checked": "2024-04-22T12:00:00Z",
  "changes": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-04-21T12:00:00Z",
      "content": {
        "Introduction": [
          "The Privacy Policy has been updated to reflect recent changes to data protection laws."
        ],
        "Data Collection": [
          "We have expanded our data collection to include new analytical tools."
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "last_update": {
    "content": {
      "Introduction": [
        "The Privacy Policy has been updated to reflect recent changes to data protection laws."
      ],
      "Data Collection": [
        "We have expanded our data collection to include new analytical tools."
      ]
    },
    "timestamp": "2024-04-21T12:00:00Z",
    "detailed_changes": [
      {
        "section": "Introduction",
        "diff": [
          "- old content line 1",
          "+ new content line 1"
        ]
      },
      {
        "section": "Data Collection",
        "diff": [
          "- old content line 2",
          "+ new content line 2"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

```

### Accessing and Using JSON Data
The JSON history files are stored within the designated history folder for each policy, typically located at a path relative to the policy's HTML file. Developers can access these files to review historical data, generate reports, or integrate change tracking into other systems.

To ensure seamless integration and manipulation of JSON data:

- Utilize JSON parsing libraries available in most programming languages, such as json in Python, to load and manipulate the data programmatically.
- Employ tools and libraries designed for handling large JSON files if dealing with extensive historical data to optimize performance.

### Contributing to History Management
Contributors interested in enhancing the history tracking capabilities of PolicyTracker can consider:

- Improving the algorithms for change detection to capture more nuanced modifications.
