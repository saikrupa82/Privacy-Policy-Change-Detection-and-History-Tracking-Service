And we use your information to\nmake improvements\nto our services \u2014 for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services. Develop new services We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones.

Provide personalized services, including content and ads We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and\ncustomized search results . For example,\nSecurity Checkup\nprovides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you\u2019ve already installed and videos you\u2019ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like. Depending on your settings, we may also show you\npersonalized ads\nbased on your interests and activity across Google services.

You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in\nMy Ad Center . We don\u2019t show you personalized ads based on\nsensitive categories , such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. We don\u2019t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos. We don\u2019t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to.

Communicate with you We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly.
